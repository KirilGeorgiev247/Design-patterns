### Creatonal Desing Patterns ###

+ Creational design patterns separate the details of object creation from the main system, which keeps the system from depending on how objects are made and put together.

+ So, to give objects specific ways of acting, you need to do more than just make new instances of a class. These patterns share two common ideas: they keep secret which specific classes are used in the system, and they cover up the creation and combination of these class instances.

+ These patterns provide great flexibility by allowing control over the creation process, including what is created, who creates it, the method of creation, and the timing of creation.
