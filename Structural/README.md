# Structural Design Patterns

***

+ Structural patterns are concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form
larger structures

+ They are fundamental part of software design and architecture, focusing on how to assemble obejects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient

+ Using inheritance and composition, objects find a way to realize new functionality and more flexibility, which come from the ability to change run - time.

+ Each of these patterns addresses specific problems in structuring code and objects in an application, often making the code more modular, scalable, and maintainable
