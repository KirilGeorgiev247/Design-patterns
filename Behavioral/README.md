# Behavioral Design Patterns

+ Behavioral patterns are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities between objects

+ They describe not just patterns of objects but also the patterns of communication between them

+ Encapsulate algorithms or processes

+ Change object roles dynamically

+ Create complex chains of communication between objects

+ Promote loose coupling, making the system more modular and easier to maintain
