# Functional Decomposition

**the code is divided into extremely small, individual functions or modules, making the overall system overly complex and hard to manage**

+ it is okay to have this when an OOP solution is not required

***

*symptoms*

+ function - like class names (Find_Median)

+ everything in a class is private, making it impossible to interact meaningfully with other classes

+ class being over - simplified having only one function

+ not taking advantage of inheritance and polymorphism

+ no potential of extendability or reusability

*causes*

+ lack of OOP principles and concepts knowledge

*solution*

+ OOP principles
