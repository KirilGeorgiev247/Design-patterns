# Golden Hammer

**when we rely too much on a familiar tool or technology for all type of tasks, when it does not quite fit the situation, which results in not so optimal solutions and oppurtunities are being passed by**

***

*symptoms*

+ design and system architecture flow is copied from already existing projects (like making a different design with the same furniture)

+ using the same tools for different tasks (using the same hammer for all type of nails)

+ slow downs the performance and interferes the scalability (like a car which does not met the road requirements)

+ having lack of knowledge and not trying to use alternative approaches (like having the same type of smartphone and not knowing about other brands)

+ lack of meeting full the requirments using already made projects (like trying to fit a square in a circle because we already have the square)

*causes*

+ the tendency to stick to a specific approach because it has reached successes in the old days

+ the influence of "Corncob" suggesting a specific solution not suitable for the given problem

+ working in the dark without doing a proper research

*solution*

+ try to expplore new technologies and approaches
